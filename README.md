# Simplest VCR Example

I've been working with VCR for some time now and felt the need to write some notes with the knowledge I gathered during my studies.

So in here you can find all my thoughts and comments (as well as the simplest code I could provide to start using it).

The sample test can be found in `vct_test.rb`, and can be ran using:

```
ruby vcr_test.rb
```

The cassete file generated by VCR in the first run is under `fixtures/vcr_cassettes/synopsis.yml`, this is the file that your tests will using from now on. To regenerate usually I just remove the file and allow VCR to do its magic again.

My thoughts are collected in `testing-with-vcr.md`

Thanks for ~listening to my mixtape~ reading!
